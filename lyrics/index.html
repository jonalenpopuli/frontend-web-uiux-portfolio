    <h2>Enchanted</h2>
    <p class="highlight">There I was again tonight</p>
     <p class="highlight">Forcing laughter, faking smiles</p>
      <p class="highlight">Same old, tired, lonely place</p>
      <p class="highlight">Walls of insincerity, yeah, yeah</p>
      <p class="highlight">Shifting eyes and vacancy</p>
      <p class="highlight">Vanished when I saw your face</p>
      <p class="highlight">All I can say is</p>
	  
      <p class="highlight">It was enchanting to meet you</p>
      <p class="highlight">Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"</p>
      <p class="highlight">Crossing paths and starry-eyed</p>
      <p class="highlight">And I said, "No, but you heard me crying"</p>
      <p class="highlight">And I saw your face and hands, mmhmm</p>
      <p class="highlight">And I said, "No, but you heard me crying"</p>
      <p class="highlight">Well, baby, I've been here before</p>
      <p class="highlight">I've seen this room and I've walked this floor</p>
      <p class="highlight">I used to live alone before I knew you</p>
      <p class="highlight">And I've seen your flag on the marble arch</p>
      <p class="highlight">And love is not a victory march</p>
      <p class="highlight">It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah</p>
      <p class="highlight">Well, maybe faith is waking up</p>
      <p class="highlight">After all our dreams were shattered</p>
      <p class="highlight">But I'm here to tell you</p>
      <p class="highlight">There's something beautiful in all my scars</p>
      <p class="highlight">Yeah, darlin', you're the one</p>
      <p class="highlight">I have been waiting for</p>
      <p class="highlight">Was it enchanting to meet you?</p>
      <p class="highlight">Oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
      <p class="highlight">This night is flawless, don't you let it go</p>
      <p class="highlight">I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home</p>
      <p class="highlight">I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
      <p class="highlight">I was enchanted to meet you</p>
      <p class="highlight">The lingering question kept me up</p>
      <p class="highlight">2 AM, who do you love?</p>
      <p class="highlight">I wonder 'til I'm wide awake</p>
      <p class="highlight">And now I'm pacing back and forth</p>
      <p class="highlight">Wishing you were at my door</p>
      <p class="highlight">I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"</p>
      <p class="highlight">And it was enchanting to meet you</p>
      <p class="highlight">All I can say is, "I was enchanted to meet you"</p>
      <p class="highlight">This is me praying that</p>
      <p class="highlight">This was the very first page</p>
      <p class="highlight">Not where the story line ends</p>
      <p class="highlight">My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again</p>
      <p class="highlight">These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon</p>
      <p class="highlight">I was enchanted to meet you</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
      <p class="highlight">Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>
	  <p class="highlight">This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<p>
	  <p class="highlight">This night is flawless, don't you let it go<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<p>
	  <p class="highlight">I was enchanted to meet you<p>
	  <p class="highlight">Please don't be in love with someone else<p>
	  <p class="highlight">Please don't have somebody waiting on you<p>
